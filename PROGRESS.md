   ## Week  1 :
   
  - All four team members from four different colleges were introduced to each other by Ankit sir . We decided to build a Contextual chatbot, using rasa . Rasa is an open source AI Framework,used  for building chat and voice based virtual assistants.
- We all started gathering information about rasa framework, through its documentation, youtube videos  and then we discussed about all the resources.
- we learnt the concept of scrum and agile methodology. The Daily Scrum Meeting is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the  team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint.
- Agile software development refers to  software development methodologies centered round the idea of iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.
- After learning the concepts , our next step is to decide which chatbot we shall build. We made a google docs and wrote our ideas . Some of the ideas were building a weatherbot , building a chatbot that can suggest some good courses or resources to learn some new technology, building a healthbot that can simply record our daily progress etc.
- We started reading about rasa framework and its components and started researching on our ideas to decide which chatbot shall we build with complete guidance.
