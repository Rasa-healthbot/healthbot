  **Tuesday**
  Available members: Manya
  
  Pragya was unwell, so we discussed the progress on text.
  Manya had tried implementing the Twilio part by watching Udemy videos and by going through Rasa documentations.
  On trying hands on Twilio part of the Project, the team started encountering issues because most guide videos available for reference had old display of Twilio.
  Manya was not able to find the Twilio webpage with links that have to be used to connect the bot using NGrok.
  Moreover there were issues with the commands to install and implement NGrok on the computer. According to some videos tgere were different processes to install Ngrok in Linux   and ubuntu, Manya had figured out how to install it in Linux, since Pragya and Akansha had projects in Windows, Manya was left to try installing NGrok on windows as well!
  It was decided Pragya would try to figure out the errors which Manya was facing to find Twilio links.
  
  Manya had been training her bot locally, the Bot worked perfectly fine except for storing values which the team still had to fig out!
  Pragya suggested to try implementing Local host, API, and environment variables for the bot to store values!
  It was decided to complete Twilio and Pipelines by the end of the week sincemanya had exams and other was unwell.
